# How To Remove Docker Containers, Images, Volumes, and Networks
Docker doesnâ€™t remove unused objects such as containers, images, volumes, 
and networks unless you explicitly tell it to do so. As you work with Docker,
you can easily accumulate a large number of unused objects that consume 
significant disk space and clutter the output produced by the Docker commands.

# Removing All Unused Objects
1. $ docker system prune
output:-
    WARNING! This will remove:
        - all stopped containers
        - all networks not used by at least one container
        - all dangling images
        - all build cache
    Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N]
    
2. $ docker system prune --volumes
output:-
    WARNING! This will remove:
        - all stopped containers
        - all networks not used by at least one container
        - all volumes not used by at least one container
        - all dangling images
        - all build cache
    Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
