# How To Remove Docker Containers, Images, Volumes, and Networks
Docker doesnâ€™t remove unused objects such as containers, images, volumes, 
and networks unless you explicitly tell it to do so. As you work with Docker,
you can easily accumulate a large number of unused objects that consume 
significant disk space and clutter the output produced by the Docker commands.

# Removing All Unused Objects

1. $ docker system prune (use the -f or --force flag to bypass the prompt)
output:-
    WARNING! This will remove:
        - all stopped containers
        - all networks not used by at least one container
        - all dangling images
        - all build cache
    Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N]
    
2. $ docker system prune --volumes
output:-
    WARNING! This will remove:
        - all stopped containers
        - all networks not used by at least one container
        - all volumes not used by at least one container
        - all dangling images
        - all build cache
    Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
    
# Removing Docker Containers
Docker containers are not automatically removed when you stop them unless 
you start the container using the --rm flag.

1. Remove one or more containers
    $ docker container ls -a (To get container list active or inactive)
    $ docker container rm cc3f2ff51cab cd20b396a061 (rm takes container ids)
    output:-
        Error response from daemon: You cannot remove a running container cc3f2ff51cab..... 
        Stop the container before attempting removal or force remove.

2. Remove all stopped containers
    $ docker container ls -a --filter status=exited --filter status=created (To list stopped container)
    $ docker container prune (use the -f or --force flag to bypass the prompt)
    output:-
        WARNING! This will remove all stopped containers.
        Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y

3. Remove containers using filters    
    $ docker container prune --filter "until=12h" 
    (To remove all images that are created more than 12 hours ago)

4. Stop and remove all containers
    $ docker container stop $(docker container ls -aq)
    $ docker container rm $(docker container ls -aq) 
    
# Removing Docker Images
Unused images, dangling images, etc. need to be remove to save disk space.

1. Remove one or more images
    $ docker image ls
    $ docker image rm 75835a67d134 2a4cca5ac898
    Note:-
        If you get an error "Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to remove repository reference.....",
        it means that the image is used by an existing container. 
        To remove the image you will have to remove the container first.

2. Remove dangling and unused images
    $ docker image prune (use the -f or --force flag to bypass the prompt)
    output:-
        WARNING! This will remove all dangling images.
        Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
    Notes:-
        1. A dangling image is an image that is not tagged and is not used by any container.
        2. When removing dangling images, if the images build by you are not tagged they will be removed too.

    $ docker image prune -a
    output:-
        WARNING! This will remove all images without at least one container associated to them.
        Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y

3. Remove images using filters
    $ docker image prune -a --filter "until=12h"

# Removing Docker Volumes

1. Remove one or more volumes
    $ docker volume ls
    $ docker volume rm 4e12af8913af888ba6.......

2. Remove unused volumes
    $ docker volume prune (use the -f or --force flag to bypass the prompt)
    output:-
        WARNING! This will remove all local volumes not used by at least one container.
        Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N]

# Removing Docker Networks

1. Remove one or more networks
    $ docker network ls
    $ docker network rm c520032c3d31
    
2. Remove unused network
    $ docker network prune (use the -f or --force flag to bypass the prompt)
    output:-
        WARNING! This will remove all networks not used by at least one container.
        Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] 

3. Remove networks using filters
    $ docker network prune -a --filter "until=12h"
